This is my tool box, containing some of my custom built tools.

It is not singular in purpose, instead dividing up sections of code I have
created. They are supposed to be "library quality" and fully documented. This
will not always be the case but I will continue to try.

There are two other text files that might interest any passer-by. The first it
DevManual.txt which has a lot of information on how the tool box is set up,
subject to change as this is a learning exprance for me too. The second is
UserManual.txt which is for anyone who wants to use the tool box, also subject
to change.

Also, it is still very deep in development (pre-alpha if you will). It is
currantly unusable as I get the supporting structure and some of the inital
tools finished.
