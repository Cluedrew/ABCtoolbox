Details of ABC Tool Box for end users:

This manual contains information on all "public members" of the tool box, all
the private members used internally are omited.

All code names (functions, classes, varaibles and so on) that are defined by
the ABCtoolbox are defined within the abc namespace and so must be accessed
with abc::NAME or by a using declaration. All terms defined by ABCtoolbox
during the pre-proccessor run begin with ABC_.

Linking:
ABClink will create a link from /usr/local/include to an internal file, the
link is called ABC. So to access the header files use:
  #include <ABC/(tool).hpp>
in your files. To compile and link the files add
  -L/usr/include/local/ABC
to the linker's call and add the approprate
  -lABC(tool)
flags as well, one for each tool you are using.

For the life of me I cannot find where I'm supposed to put the library files
themselves. Which is the reason for the use of the -L flag.
